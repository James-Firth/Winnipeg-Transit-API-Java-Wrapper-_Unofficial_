Winnipeg Transit API Java-Wrapper _Unofficial_
==============================================
Disclaimer: This is completely unofficial and still requires an API key from Winnipeg Transit.

This project is in the preliminary stages and lots of refactoring and API changes will occur.


Goals
=====

This project is designed to provide an easy package for people who want to use the Winnipeg Transit API with Java (for Android apps for instance).
